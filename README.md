# iqas-pipelines

A maven project to easily develop new QoOPipelines for the iQAS platform.

## The iQAS ecosystem

In total, 5 Github projects form the iQAS ecosystem:
1. [iqas-platform](https://github.com/antoineauger/iqas-platform) <br/>The QoO-aware platform that allows consumers to integrate many observation sources, submit requests with QoO constraints and visualize QoO in real-time.
2. [virtual-sensor-container](https://github.com/antoineauger/virtual-sensor-container) <br/>A shippable Virtual Sensor Container (VSC) Docker image for the iQAS platform. VSCs allow to generate observations at random, from file, or to retrieve them from the Web.
3. [virtual-app-consumer](https://github.com/antoineauger/virtual-app-consumer) <br/>A shippable Virtual Application Consumers (VAC) Docker image for the iQAS platform. VACs allow to emulate fake consumers that submit iQAS requests and consume observations while logging the perceived QoO in real-time.
4. [iqas-ontology](https://github.com/antoineauger/iqas-ontology) <br/>Ontological model and examples for the QoOonto ontology, the core ontology used by iQAS.
5. [iqas-pipelines](https://github.com/antoineauger/iqas-pipelines) (this project)<br/>An example of a custom-developed QoO Pipeline for the iQAS platform.

The iQAS platform have been developed during the PhD thesis of [Antoine Auger](https://personnel.isae-supaero.fr/antoine-auger/?lang=en) at ISAE-SUPAERO (2014-2017).

This research was supported in part by the French Ministry of Defence through financial support of the Direction Générale de l’Armement (DGA).
